how to talk about daily routines my daily routine is nothing special I usually wake up early around 7am breakfast is not important to me so I usually only drink a cup of coffee sometimes though I will have an apple breakfast is followed by a shower after I get dressed I go to work work is always the same during the morning I respond to emails and set up meetings around lunchtime I start to feel really hungry often my friends and I meet at a cafe to have lunch together when dinner time comes around however I cook dinner at home after dinner I take my dog for a walk to the park we can usually see the sunset which is quite beautiful I watched TV series or movies at night there is nothing like a good movie before bed I sleep at 10 pm and then start the whole routine over again the next day
